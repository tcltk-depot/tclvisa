1. Introduction
---------------

tclvisa is a dynamic library written in C. Theoretically it can be complied
and used on every platform which is supported by Tcl, VISA and has C compiler.
tclvisa is linked dynamically into a Tcl shell or any application with 
integrated Tcl interpreter. Basically one can issue "load" command to load 
library into the Tcl, but preferred way is to use "package require" command. 
Please refer to the TEA documentation for details about Tcl extensions and 
their usage:
